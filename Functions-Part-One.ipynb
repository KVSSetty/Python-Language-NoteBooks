    "If you have used `help()` in Python, then you have already seen the usage of docstrings! What it does is just fetch the **`__doc__`** attribute of that function and displays it in a neat manner for you. You can try it out on the function above - just include `help(print_max)` in your program. Remember to press the `q` key to exit help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated tools can retrieve the documentation from your program in this manner. Therefore, I *strongly recommend* that you use docstrings for any non-trivial function that you write. The `pydoc` command that comes with your Python distribution works similarly to `help()` using docstrings."
